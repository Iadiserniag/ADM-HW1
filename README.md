### .py files
- The **Ex1_IadiserniaGiulia.py** file contains the code for Problem1.  
- The **Ex2_IadiserniaGiulia.py** file contains the code for Problem2.  

Both files are structured in the following way:

<pre><code>#SECTION (i.e. Strings)

#Exercise name
#Additional comments
#Link to the exercise on Hackerrank

#--------------   

"""Code"""  

#--------------   

#Exercise name 2
...

</pre></code>

### .pdf file
The **Submissions_IadiserniaGiulia.pdf** file contains the collection of all the submissions I made (sorted by challenge).  
As can be seen in **Submissions_IadiserniaGiulia.pdf**, I tried to complete every challenge. All except 3 have gotten the full points.
